# Shaswat Kishore Prasad – Portfolio

Live-hostable single page portfolio for Shaswat Kishore Prasad. Includes hero, resume-style sections, contact form, and responsive layout inspired by the GitHub "future of building" hero design.

## Getting started

1. Serve locally with any static server (for example `npx serve` or VS Code Live Server).
2. Deploy the three files (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`) to any static hosting provider (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.).

## Customization tips

- Update contact links in `index.html` to match current details or tracking links.
- Replace the Formspree endpoint in the contact form with your own.
- Adjust gradients, colors, and fonts in `styles.css` to align with your personal brand.
- Add additional project cards or experience entries using the existing markup as a template.
- Personalize the resume-aware chatbot by editing the `knowledgeBase` responses in `script.js` and adjusting styles in `styles.css`.
